# Stream-Transport Options
1.	Constant volume routing is a simple method using only the continuity equation where flow going out of the segment 
is equal to the flow going into the segment. Volume, velocity, and depth remain constant with changing flows in this scheme. 
The application of the conservation of mass is used where outflow (Q_out)  of the stream segment of interest is equal to
the inflows (Q_in)  into the stream segment of interest. Constant volume routing is an instantaneous model so any changes in
inflows anywhere translates throughout the entire system without a time lag. Volume, velocity, width, and depth remain constant.

2.	Changing volume routing is another conservation of mass method in which, flow coming in is equal to the flow going 
out of the segment but volume, velocity, and depth change with flow based on channel hydrogeometry. Flow is propagated 
instantaneously as with constant volume routing. However, in this method volume, velocity, area, and depth change as flow
changes to maintain mass balance.
